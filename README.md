## Simulating the Motion of Gas Particles

**Project Author:** Yuyang Wang  
**Date:** 12/11/2022

## Abstract and Background

This project simulates and visualizes the motion of gas particles. It focuses on processes such as particles reaching equilibrium, bonding, and separation under various conditions. Additionally, the project explores the effect of temperature on various particle behaviors.

## Project Design

The design utilizes class inheritance for efficient code management, modular programming for reusability, and data recording and plotting for research purposes. The simulations are built upon Zelle graphics, and the project heavily relies on physical, chemical, and mathematical concepts for accurate representations.

## Science Concept

The project is rooted in kinetic theory, considering factors like particle velocity, collision elasticity, and temperature to simulate gas particle behaviors.

## Critical Evaluation

The current iteration allows for temperature manipulation. Future versions plan to include variable container volumes for a more comprehensive study.

## Visualizations and Findings

### Reaching Equilibrium

The findings indicate an inverse relationship between the average speed of particles and the time to reach equilibrium.

### Bonding Process

_Figure: The command in the terminal with the start temperature of 1 time and end temperature of 6 times and the step taking._

The data suggests that the bonding percentage is directly proportional to the average particle speed.

### Bond Separation

_Figure: The command in the terminal with the start temperature of 3.8 time and end temperature of 4.2 times and the step taking._

Similar to bonding, bond separation is influenced directly by the average speed of particles.

## Biases and Limitations

The model operates under ideal gas assumptions and does not account for real-world factors such as gravity, friction, and varying particle masses.

## Reflection

This tool serves educational purposes, enhancing the comprehension of gas particle motion through visualization. It addresses coding challenges like dynamic particle tracking and time management in Python.

## CS Concepts

Efficient coding practices were employed, including the use of modules, dictionaries for function calls, and user-interactive designs.
